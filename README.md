#Natural Disaster Countries vs CO2 emissions - Data Engineering Nanodegree

Script Goal: 
- Take these .csv data files and create an ETL to migrate data to tables in redshift 

Tables: 
- Co2emissions - emissions by country & year 
- Population - population by country & year 
- Surface Temperature - surfacetemp by country & year 
- Natural Disaster - disasters by country & year 
    - Total Death Data 
    - Total Damages
    - Number of people Injured 
    - Number of people affected
    - and much more information about the damages
